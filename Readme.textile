h1. RKLayout

Simple layout manager for iOS. 

h2. How to add to your project

To use, just drag the _RKLayout_ directory to your XCode project. 

h2. Features

* Stack views horizontally, vertically or in a grid
* Set constant spacing between views, or stretch the spacing, so that the whole container view is filled
* Align views relative to container (top, bottom, center, left, right, and all combinations)
* Animations are supported for all properties

h2. Usage

See _RKLayoutExample_ project for usage.

*Basic idea:* You create an istance of _RKLayout_, set _mode_ (horizontal, vertical or grid), and add subviews to it. Subview positions will then automatically be adjusted according to the selected _mode_. Note that subview size will never be changed by the layout manager.
